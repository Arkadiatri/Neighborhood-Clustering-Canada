    "### Original df_loc (Canada) Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) provides several geographic divisions for reporting of census statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dissemination Area: DAs are small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are disseminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate Dissemination Area: ADAs cover the entire country and, where possible, have a population count between 5,000 and 15,000 people, and respect provincial, territorial, census division (CD), census metropolitan area (CMA) and census agglomeration (CA) with census tract (CT) boundaries in effect for the 2016 Census.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Tract: CTs are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population of less than 10,000 persons, based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. They are located in census metropolitan areas and in census agglomerations that had a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Metropolitan Area/ Census Agglomeration: A CMA or CA is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more must live in the core based on adjusted data from the previous Census of Population Program. A CA must have a core population of at least 10,000 also based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. To be included in the CMA or CA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from data on place of work from the previous Census Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Subdivision: CSD is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories).\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Consolidated Subdivision:A CCS is a group of adjacent census subdivisions within the same census division. Generally, the smaller, more densely-populated census subdivisions (towns, villages, etc.) are combined with the surrounding, larger, more rural census subdivision, in order to create a geographic level between the census subdivision and the census division.\n",
    "\n",
    "Census Division: CDs are a group of neighbouring municipalities joined together for the purposes of regional planning and managing common services (such as police or ambulance services).  Census divisions are intermediate geographic areas between the province/territory level and the municipality (census subdivision).\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic Region: An ER is a grouping of complete census divisions (CDs), with one exception in Ontario, created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: CSDNAME = 'Toronto' gives the same area as the FSAs, which makes sense as this is probably the definition of 'Toronto' \n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of prefixes for NAME (N), UID (U), PUID (PU), TYPE (T), and CODE (C):\n",
    "* DA U Dissemination Area unique identifier (composed of the 2-digit province/territory unique identifier followed by the 2-digit census division code and the 4-digit dissemination area code)\n",

    "We will use census Distribution Areas as proxies for neighborhoods for cities in Canada.  In previous work where the Forward Sortation Areas (first three characters of the postal code) were used as neighborhood proxies, the sizes of many areas were quite large (several kilometers across) and therefore are likely internally non-homogeneous from a features perspective at the walking-distance (500 m) length scale.  To convert to neighborhood names we can look up the associated census tract as seen on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Toronto_neighbourhoods) Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "File lda_000b16g_e.gml was downloaded from the [Statistics Canada: Boundary Files](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2016-eng.cfm) site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the gml file and computing the area and centroid of the distribution areas can be done using the [geopandas module](https://geopandas.org/).  Geopandas builds upon [osgeo](https://gdal.org/python/index.html) which can also be used to explore and compute with the gml file, but in testing was 46 times faster due to vectorization of many calculations compared to a naive approach (see Appendix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Latitude and Longitude need to be obtained from a projection with those units, e.g. [EPSG-4326](https://epsg.io/4326).  Area can be calculated from an equal-area projection, e.g. [EPSG-6931](https://epsg.io/6931) (though a geodesic area calculation would be more accurate for larger regions, that would have to come from an additional package such as [proj](https://proj.org/), but since all regions here are small such the curvature of the earth is negligible, and altitude indtroduces an additional error likely comparable or larger to the curvature error, we will proceed with a simpler equal-area projection calculation).  The geometry is saved as text in the [Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) representation."

    "### Osgeo package\n",
    "\n",
    "Before finding the geopandas library, I was using [gdal](https://gdal.org/python/index.html) (which is one of many dependencies of geopandas).  Using gdal's ogr and osr modules in the osgeo package I read in the gml file, converted coordinates to accurately compute area, and converted coordinates again to latitude and longitude.  As a guide to learning the library I adapted code from some [examples](https://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/geometry.html#quarter-polygon-and-create-centroids).  Conversion to geojson may be done explicitly as demonstrated [here](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/77974/converting-gml-to-geojson-using-python-and-ogr-with-geometry-transformation), but by the time I was going to convert to geojson I found it much easier with geopandas, and this approach was abandoned."
